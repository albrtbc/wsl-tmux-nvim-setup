# wsl-tmux-nvim-setup

A vim configuration adapted to my workflow. The plugin can be automatically loaded with [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim), together with other plugins, as shown in the nvim files. For instance, a way to quickly configure nvim can be done copy/pasting the following command:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albrtbc/wsl-tmux-nvim-setup/main/bin/install.sh -sSf | sh && reset
```
